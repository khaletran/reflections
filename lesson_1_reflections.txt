How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By viewing the differences between the two files I could figure out why the program goes wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could save all the mistakes that I made to review them easier for the future.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	The pros of manually choosing to commit like git are you are able to control what you want to save at particular point of codes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because all the files related together.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Using the command git log to list all the differences happened among the commits. Using the commandd git diff to compare between 2 particular commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I don't know.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I have no ideas.
